title: "STAT 240: Biometrics I"
---

A broad introductory course for mathematical and applied statistics as it pertains to the biological sciences. We'll be covering everything from samples and basic graphs to distribution theory and statistical inference. My hope is that after this course every student is thoroughly prepared for further statistics courses, or at least statistically literate enough to stop their formal education here.
